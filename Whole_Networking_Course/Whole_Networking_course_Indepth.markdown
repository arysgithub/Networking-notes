# How it all started -- THE BRIEF HISTORY

Internet is a connection of computer networks on a global scale.

![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image6.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="1.6909722222222223in"}

Code war USA and Soviet Union -- who launch first satlite -- Russia won
in 1957. USA launched first program ARPA -- Advanced Research Projects
Agency -- to do scientific discoveries to have USA always on top -
developed communication techniques called arpanet -- 4 places where
computers were in different locations MIT, standford, UCLA, Utah uni.
Now they could communicate -they used TCP. More computers and lcations
so TCP/IP

![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image7.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="1.9402777777777778in"}

A PROTOCOL -- the rules/steps and regulations required to perform an
operation over the internet -- eg sending a file via email or Encrypting
a file and sending it. Eg TCP, UDP TCP/IP, SMTP.

Arpanet - Wanted to send a research paper with links to other research
papers -- ie need a way to click the link to direct me to another
research paper -\> leads into WWW -- built by TIM Burners who developed
the WWW -- a project that stores these documents and access the
documents and links via WWW.

WWW -- this is an information system where documents and their resources
are identified by uniform resource locators (URLS) which may be
interlinked by hyperlinks and are accessible over the internet.

Here is the first ever WWW:

![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image8.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.29375in"}

This is published by web servers.

How do you search for something using WWW -- you couldn't you could just
move from hyperlink to hyperlink -- so then search engines were created
eg Yahoo(one of the very first), Google. -- now everything has developed
and is continuing eg Web3 etc

Who writes the protocols and controls and then creates new rules- THE
INTERNET SOCIETY -- how to make submissions -- do by RFC -- request for
comments and give your ideas that you would like to add to the internet
or something. Internetsociety.org

# CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE 

![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image9.png){width="5.442195975503062in"
height="2.0584601924759407in"}

Sever -- a system that controls your host website, Server must be high
availability eg youtbue server -it will have many servers to prevent
crashing -- the servers are stored at Data centres -- high upload speed,
static IP addresses (don't change), very good connections

In your cmd you can do -
![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image10.png){width="4.850805993000875in"
height="3.1976913823272093in"} every packet is 64 bytes and the ip
address of the server and then the sequence number and time. The entire
time is known as ping time -- you cannot adjust the ping time

Client and servers are have processes to run.

Your computer (CLIENT) sends a request to the server to access eg
googl.com -- then server responds back to the client with whatever is
requested.

Your own computer can act as a SERVER AND A CLIENT -- especially when
you are a Local HOST

Every county is connected VIA optical wires connected under the sea

You can inspect the web page, and you can see the network information
and all the processes and protocols that happen to create the web page.

# Peer to Peer Architecture

P2P - Applications or devices connected to one another. No one dedicated
server, you can scale this very rapidly a decentralised network. Every
computer is a client and server

![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image11.png){width="2.1018153980752405in"
height="1.2228740157480316in"} - you can have a hybrid peer to peer with
a centralised system.

# PROTOCOLS

Protocols - the rules/steps and regulations required to perform an
operation over the internet

There is different protocols for different layers

TCP -- Transmission control protocol -- ensures data will reach its
destination and will not be corrupted on its way

UDP -- User Datagram protocol - not all data may be reaching its
destination eg video call (some pixels lost), stateless connection

HTTP -- Hyper text Transfer Protocol -- used by WWW and defines format
of the dat being transferred between web clients and servers

HTTPS - Hyper text Transfer Protocol SECURE -- used by WWW and defines
format of thedata being transferred between web clients and servers
securely eg utf-8

Web protocols for TCP/IP: in application layer

-   HTTP/S

-   DHCP -- dynamic host control control -- allocates Ip addresses to
    network and devices

-   FTP -- file transfer protocol

-   SMTP -- simple mail transfer protocol for sending emails

-   POP3 & IMAC - used to receive emails

-   SSH -- login into someone else's terminal and computer and take
    control

-   VNC -- virtual networking computing -- graphical control

-   Many more

Outside of tcp/ip

-   Telnet -- terminal emulation that enables a user to connect to a
    remote host or device using a tellnet client USUSALLY PORT 23 --
    manage an account or device remotely

-   UDP

### Types of HTTP methods(tell server what to do): 

Inspect network refresh

GET - requesting data

POST -- I am a client and I am giving something to the server eg
password

PUT -- put data at a specific location

DELETE -- delete information

### Status codes / ERROR CODES 

200 -- successful request

404 -couldn't find it

400 -- bad request

500 -- internal server error

1 X X =\> informational category

2 X X +\> success codes

3 X X =\> redirection codes

4 X X =\> client error codes

5 X X =\> server error codes

### COOKIES 

Http is stateless -- whenever you go back onto the site then it will
think you a new user -- but this state saving behaviour Is there this is
due to COOKIES

Cookies -- is a unique string or user value.

--it is a file stored on the clients browser -- a cookie is set on the
fist time you use a site and then the next time you go to use the site
again the saved cookie will be sent to the sites header so the server
knows who the client is and searches the database to know who is the
client.

In the interests you will see the set-cookies and you will see the
expiration dates aswell.

3^rd^ party cookies -- cookies that are set for the urls that you don't
visit eg ads for other ads and they take and use your data -- and you
should block and understand these

## How email works 

SMTP -- simple main transfer protocol to send emails

POP3 or IMAP to receive the email

You want to send entire email and for data not to be lost -- so it would
definitely use TCP so it does not get lost. \#

TO send emails

![A drawing of a letter AI-generated content may be

height="2.5909722222222222in"}

Take a look at the name server lookup command to find the name and ip
address of the server

height="2.4243055555555557in"}

To receive emails -- POP **Post Office Protocol** -- port 110 -- you
client authorise the server to give you all the new available emails to
you- so the POP server will transact and download the emails back to
you. Then you can authorize it to do other things like delete . Note
WITH POP if you delete an email on 1 device it will not be discoverable
on the server and will not show on other devices

height="2.1878051181102363in"}

IMAP -- get your emails -- Internaet message access protocol -- allows
you to view your emails on multiple devices all your information will be
kept on the server and will syncronyse with the server

## DNS -- Domain Name System, URL Uniform resource locator

Use of a domain name eg google.com by use of the DNS to connect to the
correct IP address and then it will connect to the server.

The databases are divided into different databases so they don't get
overloaded.

You can checkout who is maintaining the ROOT DNS at the website
root-servers.org

ICANN73 register all the top level domains TLD

When you go to search for a site

1.  Checks your own cache first to see if it ia in the computer

2.  The local DNS server or ISP knows all your data even the incognito
    tabs that you have searched for

3.  The .com will be checked for in the ROOT Sever if nothing it will go
    back to ISP then be sent to TLD top level domain and then TLD will
    return the IP address

4.  Then the ISP will then return the full google.com server to be
    searched with its IP address to send back to the client for its
    search

# How data is transferred and Ip Addresses

How is data transferred -- in packets and

IP Addresses -- every device has an IP address in the format X . X . X .
X - each X has a value from 0 to 255. And different classes reserved Ip
ddresses, local Ip addresses, MAC addresses

![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image20.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="1.6347222222222222in"}

ISP -internet service provider gives you a router or modem with a global
ip address -- and all devices connected to the modem will have the same
ip address from a global standpoint but within the modem there will be
local ip addresses. How does it do this USING DHCP -- dynamic host
configuration protocol to assign the local Ip addresses with the global
ip address but also manages more than that. When the D1 requests
something from the internet it will go tp the modem/router which will
then go to the ISP and to the internet and then the response will be
sent back to the ISP then modem then to client. HOW IS IT DECIDED WHO
HAS REQUESTED SOMETHING AND IS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE IT ASWELL -- the NAT
network access translator -- but which application in D1 made that
request -- IP address decides which device to send the data. But which
application is decided by the PORT NUMBERS- that's why each device has
ip addresses and port numbers

![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image21.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.310416666666667in"}

# Port Numbers

PORTS are 16 bits numbers basically Hexadecimal -- 16 cells with 1 or 0
so the total port numbers possible are 2\^16 port numbers available.

Web pages uses particular protocols eg HTTP -- the port number for HTTP
is PORT 80. Mongo DB = 27017. SQL = 1433

Well-defined ports are these reserved PORTS already.

PORTS from 0 and 1023 = have reserved ports so you cannot use them

Ports 1024 -- 49152 are for applications only

Then remaining ports further from that you can use it for yourself now

How to measure the speed of ISP:

M b p s = mega (6 zeros) bits per second

1 mbps = 1 000 000 bits per second

1 gbps = 10 \^ 9 bits per second

1 kbps = 1 000 bits per second

More zeros means the connection speed is faster

UPLOAD -- sending data from 1 device to another

DOWNLOAD -- receiving data from another device ie downloading

You can random speed tests online which can check the speed of your
connection

# Submarine Cables Map (Optical Fibre Cables)

Guided communication -- connected through the wire

Unguided communication -- communication connected by wifi or Bluetooth
for example

What about country to county -- the information will bounce off isp to
internet to isp of another county -- but at the base level each country
has cables under the ocean which connect countries to countries:
<https://www.submarinecablemap.com/>

![A map of the world AI-generated content may be

height="3.048611111111111in"}

Who controls the big cables You\'d have to research its on the internet
for different companies and they give the ability to other entities and
then to ISP so they can connect to each other eg more than28000 km of
cable that connect many counties and continents. Google owns a lot of
cables underground aswell:

The internet/cloud is not really the cloud its underground though cbales

Types of Physical cables -- optical fibre cables, coaxial cables

Wireless -- radio channels short range ie Bluetooth and Wif larger range
3G, 4G, 5G, LTE

Cables is faster than satellite

# LAN, WAN, MAN

Lan -- local area network eg small house/office many devices in a small
area

Connected using -- ethernet cable -- using bus topologies, network
adaptors, wifi

Man -- Metropoliatan area network which is across the city

Wan -- wide area network eg across countries typically using optical
fibre cables

1.  SONET -- synchronous optical networking -- transfer data using
    optical cables

2.  Frame relay -- way for you to connect from WAN to the internet

THE INTERNET IS A CONNECTION OF ALL THE 3 ABOVE

# Modem/Router 

Modem -- used to convert digital signals to analogue signals and vice
versa

Router -- a device that routes the data packets based using their Ip
addresses

TIER 1 -- top ISP providers- in the UK include BT, Vodafone, Colt,
Virgin Media, and GTT Communications, among others like Cogent, NTT, and
Arelion

-   **Core backbone providers**: 

BT, Vodafone, and Virgin Media are major UK-based providers that also
qualify as Tier 1 due to their extensive global networks and peering
agreements.

# Topologies (BUS, RING, STAR, TREE, MESH)

1.  BUS -- every system in the bus topology is connected using 1 wire/
    backbone

-   If link gets broken it will spoil the entire network

-   Only 1 person can send data over the channel at a particular time

> ![A graph paper with circles and lines AI-generated content may be

> height="2.354494750656168in"}

2.  RING -- every system communicates with one another

-   If 1 cable breaks you cannot transfer data

-   Lots of calls being made to other devices

height="2.958746719160105in"}

3.  Star -- 1 central (router) device connected to all devices

-   If the central system fails your system goes down

5.  Mesh topology -- every single computer is connected to every other
    single computer

-   Expensive, so much wire used

-   If you want to scale comouters you have to add to connect to
    everything

height="3.9172134733158357in"} this concept of ordering something from
amazon in the us to be transported to your address in India as an
example.

THE ORDER AND THE RECEIVED STEPS IS THE APPLICATION LAYER

ALL THE COMPLEXITY BEHIND THAT IS THE INTERNET

## OSI MODEL -- Open Systems Interconnection Model (7 layers) important for interviews (MORE CONCEPTUAL BASED)

Develop so that there is a standard way 2 or more devices to communicate
with each other. You send a request from a browser and these are the
steps they go through to send the request to the server and get the
response from the server back to the client it goes in the order 1 to 6
LAYERS

1.  APPLICATION LAYER - contains application eg browser

2.  PRESENTATION LAYER - encryption & abstraction (assume data is sent
    downwards and it will be taken down the funnel) & compression & ssl
    protocol used

3.  SESSION LAYER -- enables you to know the sending and receiving of
    data followed by termination of sessions & authentication &
    authorisation & abstraction

4.  TRANSPORT LAYER -- TCP or UDP protocol added. Data divided to
    Segmentation packets which will include a port number and a sequence
    number to order the packets & flow control to control the amount of
    data that is being transferred & error control and adding of a
    checksum to check if the data is true or not.

Everything before is locally on your computer now after this its
preparing to send over the internet

5.  NETWORK LAYER -- Router lives over here, this is for logical
    addressing -- assigning the senders and receivers IP address to
    every segment to form an IP packet so that every data packet can
    reach the correct destination. It also performs routing based of IP
    addresses & subnet masking, routing & load balancing. The routing
    protocols are helpful in identifying which routing method to use eg
    Dijkstra's

![](vertopal_79277091678c4a80a92a782e30e65afa/media/image29.png){width="4.302683727034121in"
height="3.2504538495188102in"}

6.  DATA LINK LAYER -- allows you to directly communicate with the
    computers and hosts & it does physical addressing -- the MAC
    addresses (Media access control 12-digit alphanumeric number of the
    NIC of your computer) of the sender and receiver are assigned to the
    packets to form a frame (a data unit of the data link layer)

7.  PHYSICAL LAYER -- PHYSICAL router hardware/mechanical layers to
    transmit the bits from electrical signals to the receiver\'s point
    over the internet & order of execution

## ANOTHER MODEL -- TCP/IP MODEL -- 5 layers (USED MORE PRACTICALLY)

Developed by arpa -- Internet Protocol suit. (Application, Presentation
and session merged in 1) called Application layer then TRANSPORT LAYER,
NETWORK LAYER, DATA LINK LAYER, PHYSICAL LAYER

In the transport layer the data we have is in segments

Only when it gets to the network layer it then becomes Packets

Then the data link layer then makes the frames

Sockets -- send messages to another person -- it's the interface between
the process and the internet

Ports -- how to determine ports HTTP port 80 -Ephemeral ports -- uses
ports while the ports are running and when they are not being use they
are freed up -- on the server side they are freed up and internally they
can use the internal ports if they know them

-   AAPLICATION LAYER -users interact with the application on your
    device e.g., WhatsApp, browser, protocols any one of these -- SMTP,
    POP3, IMAP, HTTP/S whether you want to GET POST, PUT, DELETE, it is
    a stateless protocol and uses TCP (transport later) inside it.
    client-server architecture -- they should know how to deal with the
    request and how to deal with it. The protocols, sockets, ports,
    error/status codes and cookies, email workings, DNS, URL information

1.  TRANSPORT LAYER -- layer within the devices -- take the data from
    the network to the applications on the receiver side or form the
    application to the network on the sender side. Protocol options TCP
    or UDP -- segments packers into sequence number to order the packets
    & flow control to control the amount of data that is being
    transferred & error control and adding of a checksum to check if the
    data is true or not.

height="2.9770833333333333in"}

Data travels in packets -- transport layers will attach socket, port
numbers to packets to know where and to which application to send the
data-- multiplexing -- will allow us to send different file formats of
packets to multiple destinations via one medium eg messages file and VC
within the multiplex and on the recievers side in the transport layer it
will have a De multiplexer which will pass the appropriate data through
to the right mediums using Ip addresses, and sockets/gateways within the
network with port numbers port numbers. The transport layer also takes
care of traffic (congestion control) -- congestion control algos are
built into the TCP.

height="2.2506944444444446in"}

Checksum - Knows if packets were lost using checks sum -- like a number
-- checksum Is a calculated value which is data x algo and then gives an
output which is a checksum value. Then send data, reviever will do the
same calculations if the calc is correct and checksum is correct then
data is correct, if not it is then wrong.

height="3.0125in"}

Timers -- when the data is sent a timer will be started, if the receiver
has received them and confirmation is received then timer stops- if they
have been lost and the timer runs out and the friend has not sent the
confirmation, then the data system will know that some packets have been
lost and the timer will expire and then the same packet will ty to be
retransmitted

height="3.0118055555555556in"}

BUT: sequence numbers solve duplicates where the confirmation received
is not sent back yet. So it will compare sequence numbers and if theres
2 sequence numbers then its a duplicate

UDP user datagram protocol:

Used to pass data from application to network layer and from network
layer to application layer -- but the problems is that data may not be
delivered or data may change or data may not be in order. THIS IS A
CONNECTION LESS PROTOCOL ie no connection established between the 2
devices. UDP uses checksums -- but if they are not correct it doesn't
matter. Use it because it is faster, perfect for video calls even if
there is loss of quality

UDP packets -- will have all of the above previous to the udp heading +
will have a source port number and destination port number in a pacjket
available -- the length of datagram and there will be a checksum (all
this is your header) then your data -- so your total data would be

height="3.6166666666666667in"}

Total data you can send in 1 packet = 2\^16 -- header which is 8 bytes

DNS use cases of UDP -- very fast, video conferencing apps, DNS uses UDP
coz very fast, gaming uses UDP

Sudo tcpdump -c 5 to only show last 5 packets

TCP transmission control protocol;:

-   Taking data from transport to network and from network to transport
    -- transport layer protocol

-   Application layer sends lots of raw data -- TCp segments this data
    -- divide into packets -- adds header etc all the above before UDP
    -- it also collects the data network layer

-   Does congestion control aswell -- takes care of when data does not
    arrive, maintains the sequencing order of data using sequence
    numbers

Features

-   Makes sure there is a connection established between devices first
    before sending data - then sending synchronisation flag with a
    random sequence number (for security). Receiver sends syncronisation
    with acknowledgement with seq numer , thank you I will begin sending
    the data called the 3 way handshake

height="3.6479166666666667in"}

-   Error control

-   Congestion control

-   Full duplex -- 2 computers connected 2 each other from A to B and
    you can both send files simultaneously to each other -- can only be
    2 endpoints for each tcp connection

2.  NETWORK LAYER - Protocols -- IP

Here we work with Routers that have many other routers connected to each
other. Every router has its own Network Address allow us to send the
data packets to check in its routing table or forwarding table to check
every destination address -- or the ROUTING TABLE will contain source
address destination address and the forwarding table will identify the
destination address and use hop-by-hop routing to route the packet to go
to the appropriate address to the next router till it reaches its right
destination which happens over ISP providers

height="1.65625in"} this is called subnetting masking -- subnet has the
subnet which contains the newtwork address for that specific router and
also the host id which contains the device within that specific routers
local network

Who creates and adds the routing tables where does it come from --
CONTROL PLANE -- used to build the routing tables (like a graph) so
routers are nodes then the links between routers are the edges:

-1 - Static Routing -- adding routing addresses manually

-2 - Dynamic Routing -- evolves accordingly with change in algorithms --
using Dijkstra

Protocols -- IP (internet protocol )addresses : - uniquely defines a
server, client, node or a router

IPv4 -- 2\^32 bits = 4.3 billion so 32 bit numbers with 4 words eg 5 .
6. 9. 14 these are each 8 bit numbers x 4 = 32 bits ![A graph paper with

height="0.8015704286964129in"} but now this can run out

IPv6 -- 128bit numbers with 6

Classes of IP addresses

height="2.8179844706911634in"}

Subnet masking -- the mask the network part of the ip address and leaves
us to use the host id part -- eg CLASS E is usually for 255 . 255 . 0 .0
-- to beable to tell which categority it belongs to

Variable length subnet -- you can set your own length of the subnet
network -- eg

height="0.6831167979002625in"} eg 31 bits are my subnet part and the
remaining 1 is mine to allocate to my local devices because I have 32
bits in a IPv4 so

If you look at it in binary 8bits .8bits .8bits . 7 bits for subnet and
then the remainder 1 bit is for my devices

height="0.8751224846894138in"} total is 32 bits but 24 bits would not
change as they are the subnet id -- mine would be the last 8 bits for me
to change and allocate to my devices eg 192 . 0. 1. 255 to make a total
of 256 = 32 bits

Who allocates ISP IP addresses = THE ITERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE --
was on a first come first serve basis -- IBM, MIT so got allocated class
A now with the IETF -- they don't use classes anymore but they assign
based on regions

RESERVED IP ADDRESSES = 127 . 0. 0. 0./8 = means the 127 you cannot
change but the 0 .0 .0 you can change eg local host is 127.0.0.1 - these
are known as loop back addresses -THESE RUN ON YOUR MACHINE using your
TCP IP controls ad can allow you to be a client and server at the same
time -- the system will always be up aslong as your local host device is
up and running

PACKETS -- header is of 20 bytes containing IP version -- total length,
ID number, flags protocols, check sum, addresses, etc etc -- contains
TTL

TTL -- time to live = may be that a packet my be stuck in a loop of hops
and may not reach the TTL is 60 -- so if the packet has been hopping for
more than 60 hops it will be dropped with checksum etc

3.  DATA LINK LAYER

responsible for sending these packets over a physical link -- transport
your data between connected devices using DHCP and subnets and how it
allocates Ip address with many devices connected in a LAN.

The data link layer addresses this is the MAC ADDRESS OF YOUR DEVICE
(whether its your wifi will be different from your Bluetooth )

Every device connected in a LAN -- will have the data link layer address
to addresses in the destination , now device 1 want to send to device 4
within the LAN:

a.  Checks its own cache it previously sent there if not

b.  Asks in the ARP Address resolution protocol Cache (which all devices
    in the LAN will receive a message in a frame that will contain a
    request of the data link layer address (MAC) of sender and Ip
    address of destination

c.  And then it updates the ARP cache and the device 1 will send to
    device 4

height="2.725in"}

MAC address makes a request and then the data comes back to your router
the router will attach the correct private ip address to the data
packets ensuring that the router corresponds to the correct device. The
private and public Ip address will remain the same but the MAC address
of the routers will keep changing from router to router when travelling
inside the internet. You can also block certain MAC addresses aswell

Use the command config to check your Mac Address.
